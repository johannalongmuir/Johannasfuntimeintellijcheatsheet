### RENAMING: <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F6</kbd>

(or <kbd>Function</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F6</kbd> if can't see F keys on MAC). This will rename variable or method everywhere. 
Pay attention when using this as you may get a pop up box asking if you want to rename just this method or variable, or all of them.  




### EXTRACT VARIABLE: <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>
Will pull out selected as a variable within the method. Usually will be added on the line above the extraction.
